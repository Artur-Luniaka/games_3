          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to GameZone. This Cookies Policy explains how we use cookies
            and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our
            website. It explains what these technologies are and why we use
            them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
          </p>

          <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            A cookie is a small data file that is placed on your device. It is
            widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well
            as to provide reporting information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, GameZone) are called
            "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website
            owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable
            third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through
            the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics).
          </p>

          <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>
          <p>We use first-party cookies for several reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly
              necessary to provide you with services available through our
              website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure
              areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance and Functionality Cookies:</strong> These
              cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of
              our website but are non-essential to their use. However, without
              these cookies, certain functionality (like remembering your cart)
              may become unavailable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Analytics and Customization Cookies:</strong> These
              cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form
              to help us understand how our website is being used or how
              effective our marketing campaigns are.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How can you control cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
            You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in
            the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to
            select which categories of cookies you accept or reject.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse
            cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
            website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
            website may be restricted.
